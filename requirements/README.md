## 1. The volume, goals and outputs of a thesis 

* students learn what has been previously achieved and published in their area
* what constitutes a research result or applied research result
* how to achieve it
* how new research ideas and applications are formed and developed
* how hypotheses are being checked
* which methodologies are used and how the results are published
* The thesis must be written and formatted in the manner
that allows any person at the same level of study to understand it
* important to pay due
attention to the problem statement and the task set-up, to describe the related background with
enough detail and to elaborate on basic definitions and ways of reasoning
* Specific knowledge of journal or conference paper results cannot be a prerequisite to the
understanding of a thesis (such material should always be summarised in the thesis).

### 1.2 Master's thesis
* A master’s thesis is a part of the research
and development process or creation of teaching methodology materials
* its results must be usable in a later research by the author or anybody else within the area of research. 
* The work must include new (ideally publishable) results, i.e. solutions or statements that are not generally known, or broaden understanding of known phenomena, methodologies, results, etc.
* approximate volume of a master's thesis is from 40 to 50 pages.


### 1.3 Types of graduation thesis
* A graduation thesis can focus either on theoretical or **applied research**.

#### 1.3.2 Applied research
* Applied research thesis can be based on a software solution created by the author, on **testing of software or hardware**, or it can be built upon the learning material compiled by the author or upon the existing learning material.

#### 1.3.2.2 Hardware or software testing
* The thesis can be related to a study of software, as well as of hardware (comparing different types), or to the experimental application of software or hardware.
* The thesis should include a problem description
* an explanation for what the specific software or hardware is needed
* an overview of existing analogues and the objectives and results of the testing
* This type of thesis may involve the testing of an e-learning software or hardware during its creation, or carrying out the teaching activities with it at a university or other educational institutions.
* The methodology used in the thesis must be reasoned and justified. An original user manual created by the student may be a part of the thesis or the thesis may be based on the manual.

## 2. The rights and duties of supervisors and persons supervised 
* The quality of a thesis depends on an author and on a supervisor, as well as on the cooperation between them
* A student chooses the topic of a thesis in collaboration with his/her supervisor by the due date established for an autumn term (01/11/2021) that precedes the expected defence of the thesis.
* A student may contact a programme manager with a request to find a suitable supervisor.

### 2.1 The rights and duties of students
* A student is responsible for the content and form of his/her thesis.
* A student has the right to receive feedback from his/her supervisor on his/her thesis within the agreed time limit.
* A student must be active and make contact with his/her supervisor in order to agree the terms of co-operation and the schedule of supervision
* Participate in the meetings agreed with the supervisor
* Meet the agreed deadlines
* Take the recommendations of the supervisor into account when writing his/her thesis
* Write his/her thesis independently and if working in a larger team, point out clearly his/her contribution
* Know and follow the correct citation rules in order to prevent any suspicion of plagiarism and be aware of the consequences of plagiarism. 
* It is advisable to use a plagiarism detector programme.
* Students are responsible for the correct spelling and style of their theses and submit linguistically correct theses to supervisors for feedback.


### 2.2 The rights and duties of supervisors
* A supervisor must help the student to choose the topic of his/her thesis and advise him/her at every stage
when writing it
* Agree to the schedule of work and explain to the person he/she supervises the requirements established for the theses
* Give feedback to the student about the goal, structure and main problems related to the thesis
* Help the student to choose the material needed for preparing the thesis
* Advise a student to use a plagiarism detector programme or any other relevant means to exclude the possibility of plagiarism
* Give feedback on the thesis within agreed time limits
* Advise the student on issues related to the presentation of his/her thesis at the defence and introduce him/her to the defence procedure
* Know the Institute’s requirements for graduation theses and proceed from these requirements during the process of supervision.
#### 2.2.1 The rights of supervisors:
* A supervisor does not have to correct orthographic mistakes, grammar or style of a thesis, but should draw the student’s attention to the mistakes in it and, if necessary,
give the students the recommendations for improving the legibility of the text
* A supervisor has the right to deny the graduation thesis to the defence if the supervisor has not been familiarised with it or if he/she is not convinced that the thesis complies
with the requirements established for graduation theses

### 2.3 The submission of a thesis and being allowed to the defence
* An author of the completed thesis shall upload it to the register of theses at http://comserv.cs.ut.ee/ati_thesis/index.php?language=en
* The electronic file of a thesis must include an appropriate common license for the reproduction and public distribution of the thesis
* A supervisor shall add his/her written opinion on the compliance with the requirements established for theses.
* A supervisor shall make the proposal for the appointment of an opponent.
* The student must have completed all the courses in the curriculum before his/her thesis is allowed to be defended
* The head of the Institute shall confirm that the thesis is allowed to be defended
* A supervisor shall present a thesis to an opponent at least five days before the defence
* An opponent shall present his/her review at least 24 hours before the defence to an academic affairs specialist and the author of a thesis

## 3. The structure and format of theses
### 3.1 Language and style
* The wording and phrasing should be precise and logical, avoiding obscurity and longwindedness
* Avoid slang, journalistic and populist language, as well as the use of poetic and figurative expressions inherent to spoken language
* Avoid self-reference such as “… as I explained in the previous Chapter, …”)
* Write as shortly as possible but still as much as necessary.

### 3.2 The structure and main components of a thesis
The typical structure of a thesis consists of the following components:
```py
1. Title page
2. Information sheet
3. Table of Contents
4. Introduction
5. Terms and notions (optional)
6. Chapters
7. Summary
8. References
9. Appendices 
10. License 
```
### 3.2.1 The title page and information sheet of a thesis
* A title page presents the name of the educational institution and the curriculum, the title of a thesis, the name of its author, the type of the paper, the name(s) of the supervisor(s), the year, location.

* The information sheet consists of the following information in Estonian as well as in English:
```py
1. Title of the paper
2. Short abstract
3. Keywords
4. CERCS (Common European Research Classification Scheme) code of the scientific area of the paper
```
* The title of a thesis should not be too long, preferably not more than one and a half lines.

* When formulating the title, it is better to avoid the need for the internal punctuation
* If the title is in English, all words shall be in capital letters (except articles and conjunctions).

### 3.2.2 Table of Contents
* If possible, the table of contents should be built automatically using the relevant functionality of the word processor in use
* It is appropriate to use up to 2 to 3 levels of headings. 
* It is important to a note that the table of contents itself is not included in the contents.

### 3.2.3 Introduction
The introduction of a thesis must consist of the following components:

>- Justification to the choice of topic (its actuality and novelty)
>-  The purpose of the thesis
>-  The overview (of the theoretical background) that includes references to previously published research (a longer theoretical overview can form a separate chapter following the introduction)
>- Problem statement (if necessary, it should include the posed hypothesis/hypotheses, research question(s), a subject of research)
>-  The description of the structure of the thesis by chapter >- a short overview of appendices (including the content of attached materials)
>- Any of the above-listed components may form a separate chapter or a part of a chapter.

### 3.2.4 Terms and Notions
* This includes the definitions of specific terms and notions with their foreign equivalents used in the thesis. It is not necessary to list any well-known terms. The presentation of terms used in the thesis as a distinct chapter is not obligatory

### 3.2.5 Chapters
* The main body of a thesis is presented in chapters
* In general it is reasonable to divide the text into 3 to 5 numbered chapters 
* Each chapter starts on a new page. 
* A chapter can be divided into sections. However, in this case a chapter has to include at least two sections.
* Longer sections can be further divided into sub-sections. 
* It is not recommended to go beyond 3 levels for sections.
* A new section shall be started on a new page only if the previous page does not have room for the title and at least two rows of text.
* The titles of chapters and sections should not contain hyphenation, interrogative words, interrogative sentences, subordinate clauses, punctuation, phrases and abbreviations in a foreign language (unless it is essential). 
* There is no full stop at the end of a title.
* It is advisable to start each chapter with a short introduction which certainly cannot be longer than half a page and place it before subheadings that will follow. If such an introductory paragraph is written in one chapter, it is reasonable to add them to every chapter. 
* It is advisable to end each chapter with a smooth passage into the next chapter.

### 3.2.6 Summary
* The summary must clearly state the main results of the thesis. 
* This part of the thesis should not introduce new ideas, arguments or reasoning that were not present in the main body of the thesis. 
* A sensible approach would be to refer to the goal of the thesis and, after that, construct the text of the summary in the manner that shows clearly how the goal was achieved and what was the author’s contribution to it.
* The summary may contain a short overview of the possible ways and perspectives for the further development of the work done. This section may, as an alternative, form a separate chapter before the summary.
* It is advisable to use the simple past and passive voice in the summary, for example “In the thesis it was shown ..., described ..., solved ...”, although the present tense is also acceptable.

## 3.3 Formatting of written papers
* The text must be aligned on both sides. 
* It is advisable to use serif fonts (e.g. Times New Roman). 
* The font size must be 12 points and the line spacing should be set to no less than 1.0 and no more than 1.5. 
* Space between words must be minimised by using hyphenation. As to compound words, division should occur between the two constituent words. 
* In titles and headings, hyphenation should be avoided.
* The pages must be numbered. 
* The position for page numbers is at the bottom, either in the
centre or on the right of the page. 
* There should be no page number on the title page.

### 3.3.1 Figures and tables
* Figures are numbered and captioned. 
* The caption together with the number is placed below
the figure, for example “Figure 3. An explanation of this figure.”
* If a figure has been taken from an outside source, there has to be a reference to the source at the end of the caption, for example “Figure 17. An explanation of this figure [1].”
* Numbering can be sequential throughout the thesis (the preferred style) or sequential within each chapter, using the following pattern: <chapter-number.sequence-number-withinchapter>.
* The same rules apply also to tables. The only difference is that the number and caption are written above the table.
* NB: Tables have titles and figures have captions.
* There must be a reference to every figure and table in the text. 
* Figures and tables should locate as close as possible to the first reference to them in the text, for example, “Table 2 presents data …“, „Figure 3 presents/shows/gives …”, “the Figure 3 presents the graph.”
* Chapters and sections must not end with a table, figure or list.
* Figures and tables should be of a high quality, comprehensible and support the information in the text.

### 3.3.2 Lists
* Every list must be preceded by an explanation for using it,  for example:
``` 
The main arguments are the following:
 The first argument;
 The second argument;
 ...
```
* In case of longer lists (more than five elements) it is better to use numbers or letters, not identical symbols such as dots.

### 3.3.3 Abbreviations
* File name extensions are expressed either as capitalised abbreviations if it is a name (e.g. PDF, thus a PDF file, as well as a ZIP file or a compressed file) or as a lower case abbreviation that are preceded by a dot that refers to the fact that it is a file extension (e.g. files with
the extension .docx are uploaded).
* Words behind abbreviations, except the very common ones, must be written out fully when they first occur in the text. 

### 3.3.4 Symbols
* Symbols of mathematical objects are printed in italics, except the names of operations and functions (e.g. log, max, sin).
* All formulas that are referred to in text must be numbered.
* Numbers and brackets are written upright 
* The names of programme objects (identifiers, keywords, operators) occurring in the thesis text are also printed in italics or brought out by monospace font (e.g. Courier New).

### 3.3.5 Names of directories, files, programmes, etc.
* Names, especially trademarks have to be written exactly in the manner required by the owner of a trademark (or name). It is important in the case of names and trademarks where the initial letter is written in a lower case or where capital letters or any other signs are used in the middle of the word (e.g. non-breaking hyphens).
* Directories and files have names that are written between quotation marks or in italics. For example: …"Idea" and "Sandbox" directories are stored … ~ directories, such as Idea and Sandbox; the file called "test_helper.py" is located in the directory named "Idea".)
* Hardware and software products just like any other products have names which do not require any quotation marks. For example, (laptop) Desknote B920 Pro, (printer) Laserjet 1000, (operation system) Windows 10, (Microsoft programmes) Word, PowerPoint, Outlook, Excel, etc.
* Web portals such as Instagram, Twitter and Facebook are also names.

### 3.3.6 Appendices
* Numerical data and other materials necessary for solving the research problem, but not necessarily presented in the text, or if the material is too extensive (background data for research, source codes of programmes, documentation, tables, etc.), should be presented as appendices.
* The text must include a reference to each appendix i.e. all the appendices must be related to the text. Appendices should be numbered according to the reference to them in the main text.
* The number of an appendix should be displayed in bold letters in the left hand margin of the page, followed by the title of the appendix. 
* There is no full stop at the end of a title. 
* Each appendix must start on a new page. 
* If the text, picture, table, etc. presented in an appendix is not owned by an author a precise reference must be made to its origin.

## 3.4 Citation and list of references
* Citing is an academic tradition acknowledging authors of the ideas, statements, data, etc. used in a text. It also gives the reader an opportunity to view to the source. 
* The sources referred to in a thesis must be authoritative and academic, unless otherwise justified. For example, articles of Wikipedia are not considered academic.

### 3.4.1 Citation
When reference is made note that:
* a reference to the original source should be made every time another author’s work is either reviewed, summarised, quoted or copied – it does not matter, whether it is textual, graphic or audio-visual material
* usually references are made twice: once in the text and the more detailed one in the list of references at the end of thesis
* whichever reference style has been chosen it is important to follow the same style throughout the whole thesis
* it is advisable to use an automatic reference management system included in many word processors.
* Several bibliography styles (e.g. IEEE, APA, ACM, SIAM etc.) have been invented. However, in computer science, mainly the following styles are used:
>* 1) numbered references i.e. Vancouver style 
>* 2) AMS style (American Mathematical Society)
>* 3) APA style (American Psychological Association)

* The numbered citation style is convenient because the citation is short – a number that helps to easily find the source included in the list of references. However, this can be more difficult to grasp as the reader has repeatedly to check the list of reference. 
* In the case of using the author(s) name abbreviations style it is easier to modify and add new references while writing
the text and it is also easier for a reader to understand the references. In the case of subsequent references to the same source it is also easier to notice that the reference to the source has already been made.

* The citation within the sentence usually applies to the referred sentence. For example:
```
Machine translation became a subject of research in Estonia in the end of 1950s when some
mathematicians at the University of Tartu, led by Ülo Kaasik, tried to translate mathematical
texts from Russian into Estonian [1].
```

* If a reference is made to an extensive text (e.g. for a whole paragraph), the citation has to be formulated in the manner that clearly conveys the ideas of the author who is being cited. For example:
```
Mare Koit, et al. [1] have written that machine translation became a subject of research in Estonia as early as at the end of 1950s when some mathematicians of the University of Tartu, led by Ülo Kaasik, tried to translate mathematical texts from Russian into Estonian. Some programmes were created for the Ural computer which was ridiculously slow compared with the
ones in use today: 100 operations in a minute which did not allow for an effective translation.
According to her this work gradually lagged.
```
* In order to review the whole paragraph, it is useful to use introductory clauses, for example:
```
The following paragraph is based on the article of A. Isotamm [2]…
The following material is a review of the textbook by R. Prank [3]… etc
```

* Sometimes it is necessary to summarise references and present them as footnotes. This method is especially convenient for referring to directories, files, applications, etc., making the text much more reader friendly.
* References should be made according to the principle that sentences should be eligible without reading the reference and the reference should be made logically within a sentence. Thus,
the constructions such as: 
```
“therefore, [2] argues that …” 
```
should be avoided.

* It is useful to consult your supervisor who can help you to choose the most suitable citation style and follow his/her recommendations on the correct use of it.

### 3.4.2 Requirements to the list of references and some examples
* The list of references should include only the sources used and cited within the thesis and may not include any references that cannot be directly associated with the text of the thesis.
* In organising the list of references two options can be used:
>* 1. Alphabetical order - based on the authors’ names
>* 2. The order of succession of the references cited in the text.
* The first option is convenient due to the simplicity of finding source information also outside the scope of the thesis text via the name of the author. As to the second option, it is easier to keep track of references while reading the text in sequential order.
* Some guidelines:
> 1. The bibliography section is titled the “References”.
> 2. All details concerning the referenced source are taken from the work’s title page and/or the reverse of the title page.
> 3. A reference record is compiled in the language of the referenced source and it consists of several elements that are presented in a particular order. It includes a
minimum but necessary amount of details that allow the work to be found from the library, database, or the Internet.
> 4. As the reference record is in the same language as the publication, the abbreviations are also in the respective foreign language, for example, page, edition and volume are
in English p., Ed., Vol, and in German S., Aufl., Bd.
> 5. If the author of the source is an institution/organisation or the author is not included at all, the source is entered alphabetically in the references list by the first word of the title.
> 6. In case where the reference list is formed according to the alphabetical order works from one author are ranked by the year of publication, starting from the earliest
> 7. If the references list has works from the same author published in the same year, the differentiation is made with the help of lower case letters, e.g. 1993a, 1993b.
> 8. In the case of several authors (from three to five), all the names are included in the list of reference. However, reference in the text should include only the name of the first
author and the existence of other authors is acknowledged with the abbreviation et al.
> 9. If the year of publication of the work is unknown, the abbreviation s.a. (sine anno) is used.
* For example:
> 1) For a book 
```

## 4. Defence procedure
* Graduation theses shall be defended on dates determined by defence committees. 
* The dates and places for defence with the relevant time tables [shall be published on the website of the Institute of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ut.ee/en/studying/guidelines-regulations). 
* A graduation thesis is defended in the form of an academic 
debate. 
* Depending of the type of a thesis the following time limits are established for the presentation:
>- 15 minutes for a master’s thesis
>- The main stages of the defence procedure are the following:
>- the author’s presentation
>- questions related to the presentation
>- opinion of the opponent
>- general discussion
>- opinion of the supervisor
>- he author’s final remarks

* Public presentation is a part of the defence procedure of bachelor’s and master’s theses. 

### 4.1 The structure of the presentation of a thesis at a public defence
* The presentation should be structured and the topics should follow each other logically. 
* The presentation consists of five main parts:
> 1. introduction, description of the goal and research task, overview of the structure of a thesis
> 2. description of methods, approach and hypotheses
> 3. description of the work process
> 4. presentation of results
> 5. conclusions, summary.

* The introduction should not be just a statement of the problem but indicate the presenter’s motivation to solve the problem. 
* It is important to describe the process of solving the problem and the choices the author had to make to achieve the final results.
* The results should be summed up shortly and clearly, pointing out only the most important details.

### 4.2 Preparing of a presentation
* It is not advisable to present too much material. 
* Good presentation includes one or two central
points. 
* The point of a presentation is to communicate (scientific) results. However, the presentation should not be too superficial. 
* The most important aspects should be introduced in a more detailed manner than the rest of the work. 
* It is better to start immediately with the examples that illustrate the problem in the most expressive way. 
* In the case where complex formulas are shown on slides they should be explained to the audience.

### 4.3 Use of examples
* The use of relevant and comprehensible examples is the best way to explain the content of the work to an audience. Otherwise, the presentation may become too abstract and elusive for listeners. 
* Examples that explain what a definition, property, mathematical structure, new term, theorem, idea, technique or algorithm really involves offers a better overview of their genuine essence. 
* Practical examples that connect the subject of the research with real life are especially good.

### 4.4 Use of technical equipment
* When preparing for the presentation a student should consider what sort of equipment is available for it. 
* It is recommended to prepare slides. 
* The safest option is to use the formats which are created and shown with the same software, therefore, it is best to use a presentation software that includes a presenter view that shows the remarks on the slides, time that is used for the presentation and an overview of slides to come. 
* In the case of more specific needs it is wise to check which file formats are supported by the computer to be used for the presentation or to use a personal computer. 
* It is also worth checking how to transfer your presentation to
the computer used for presentation.
* Check the Internet connection and make a copy on a memory stick, if necessary. Be ready for an alternative solution if one of the options fails.


## 5. Grading of theses

## 5.1 Components of the grade
* Theses are graded on the basis of the following four criteria:
> ## 1. Content

>- Topicality, actuality, academic value (the use of scientific literature), authoritativeness (work of acknowledged authors) and comprehensiveness (whether all the relevant topics are covered) of primary sources

>- The level of analysis and synthesis of literature

>- Validity and comprehensiveness of the method(s) used

>- Logicality of the approach to the topic

>- Reasoned and comprehensive comparison of the results achieved with previous results

>- Applicability of the results

>- Novelty of the results

>- Quality of the created software

> ## 2. Level of complexity

>- Compliance of the thesis to the requirements established for master’s theses
>- Complexity of novel (scientific) results, viewpoints, created software and approach to the topic presented in the thesis
>-  Amount of processed material

> ## 3. Appearance

>- Academic, correct and clear use of language
>- Good technical realisation (clear and logical structure
>- the quality of tables, figures and other illustrative material)
>- Accuracy of citing (were the rules of the chosen reference style followed; whether all sources are referred to and whether the sources of all the references are provided, etc.)
>- Cohesion of the text (whether the different parts of the thesis form an integral unity).

> ## 4. Presentation
>- The structure and logicality of the presentation
>- The clearness of the presentation, the use of examples
>- The correct use of language
>- The capability of answering questions and participating in discussion.

* An opponent makes an evaluation suggestion regarding the first three criteria according to the grading scale

* A defence committee evaluates besides the first three criteria also the presentation by an author and takes into account the evaluation of an opponent.

## 5.2 Grading scale

* Each criterion is graded separately as follows:
```py
5: Very good
4: Good
3: Barely acceptable
2: Poor
1: Very poor
```

### 5.2.1 Explanation of the scale
* As a general rule, only the first four grades should be used. 
* Decimal points can be used in positive grades.
* Grade 1 (very poor) should be used only in exceptional cases: if the thesis clearly violates the basic principles of an academic work (for example, in the case of plagiarism). Grade 1 in any of the criteria automatically means F (fail) as a final grade.
* Grade 2 (poor) is a negative grade which should be used if the thesis does not meet the minimal requirements established to the criterion concerned. Grade 2 in two criteria automatically means F (fail) as a final grade.
* Grade 3 (barely acceptable) is the lowest positive grade which should be used in the case when the work meets the minimal requirements of the criterion, but contains some substantial shortcomings.
* Grade 4 (good) means that the thesis is a good work without major shortcomings.
* Grade 5 (very good) requires that the work is almost flawless according to the given criterion and is outstanding in some aspect.

### 5.2.2 Final grade

The suggested final grade is derived from the {sum of criterion points} x 5 according to the following scale:

```js
A: 91–100 (excellent)
B: 81–90 (very good)
C: 71–80 (good)
D: 61–70 (satisfactory)
E: 51–60 (pass)
F: 50 or less (fail)
```
