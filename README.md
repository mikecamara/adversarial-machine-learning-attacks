# Adversarial Machine Learning Attacks

This repository is a living document to organise the work around my thesis for a [Masters degree in Software Engineering](https://www.cs.ut.ee/en/studying/software-engineering-msc) program offered by the [Universtiy of Tartu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tartu) in association with [Tallinn University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallinn_University_of_Technology).

This document was created to help me deliver a [high-quality](https://www.cs.ut.ee/sites/default/files/cs/guidelines_for_graduationtheses_atut_iofcs_2017.pdf) master thesis on time.

## Target ðŸŽ¯
**Defence in June 2022** 

The experiment consists of applying the [IBM Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART)](https://adversarial-robustness-toolbox.org/) to provide state-of-the-art tools to evaluate, defend, and verify the Machine Learning models used to drive a [real-world autonomous car](https://softwareengineering.netlify.app/donkey-car/).

Using Adversarial Machine Learning Attacks against cars [has been done](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-83903-1_14) in a simulation enviroment. However, to our knowledge, such threats [have not been attempted](./references/README.md) against real-world vehicles before.
