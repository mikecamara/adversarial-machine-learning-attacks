# Included Publications

[Attack and Fault Injection in Self-driving Agents
on the Carla Simulator â€“ Experience Report](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-83903-1_14.pdf)
```
This paper was the first reference to the topic and the author uses the IBM Adversarial Tool Box to attack Machine Learning models that steer and drive an autonomous car in a simulation environment, causing the car to increase crashes to other cars and collisions with walls.
