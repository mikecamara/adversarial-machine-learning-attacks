This repository is a living document to organise the work around my thesis for a [masters degree in software engineering](https://www.cs.ut.ee/en/studying/software-engineering-msc) program offered by the [University of Tartu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tartu) in association with [Tallinn University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallinn_University_of_Technology) and it was created to help me deliver a [high-quality](https://www.cs.ut.ee/sites/default/files/cs/guidelines_for_graduationtheses_atut_iofcs_2017.pdf) master thesis on time.

Using adversarial machine learning attacks against cars to evaluate the safety of their DNNs [has been done](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-83903-1_14) in a simulation environment. However, to our knowledge, such threats have not been attempted against real-world scaled vehicles before.
