## Method 
### Systematic Mapping Study (SMS)
* **Focus of the review**
>* Identify and classify what evidence is available (broad review) in a specific topic or area
>* Establish the state of evidence 
* **Research Questions**
>* Broader RQs
>* Multiple RQs 
>* Consider only population and intervention
>* Search string less highly focused
* **Methods for searching**
>* Search string less highly focused
* **Methods for selecting**
>* A large number of studies are considered(broad coverage)
>* The studies are not evaluated in details
* **Methods for data extraction**
>* The primary studies are not assessed regarding their quality
>* Much broader classification and categorization stage
>* It is not time-consuming task
* **Synthesis**
>* Include no-depth analysis techiniques, e.g, toatl and summaries
* **Dissemination of the results**
>* May be more limited, the aim is to influence the future of the research in a specific topic

>**3. Study Selection and Quality Assessment**

## Inclusion Criteria (applied to titles and abstracts):
* Studies present the research method and result of a systematic
mapping study.
* Studies are in the field of software engineering.
* Studies were published online in the time frame 2004 (first systematic review and evidence-based software engineering guidelines were
published) to 2012 (the study was conducted during 2013).

## Exclusion Criteria:
* Studies presenting summaries of conferences/editorials or
guidelines/templates for conducting mapping studies.
* Studies presenting non-peer reviewed material.
* Studies not presented in English.
* Studies not accessible in full-text.
* Books and gray literature.
* Studies that are duplicates of other studies.

## Quality Criteria applied to identified primary studies:
* Is the motivation for conducting systematic mapping clearly stated?
* Is the process of conducting systematic mapping clearly defined
(study identification, data extraction, classification)?
* Is there any empirical evidence for the defined mapping process?
* This question is concerned with whether the results of the mapping study are presented. That is, studies focusing on evaluating mapping studies without presenting their results are excluded.

# Plan Argument

## Introduction (area of study)
AI models are responsible for taking decisions in behalf of a the humans such as steer a car autonomously in high speed roads. Adversarial Machine Learning is an area that studies the impact of malicious attacks and threats in such models.

## The problem (that I tackle)
The automobile industry need to make their AI systems more secure, but there is still no known evidence to determine how such systems perform under attack.

## What the literature says about this problem
The literature describes several state-of-the-art methods for attacking and defending classifiers that allow rapid crafting and analysis of attack and defense methods for machine learning models.

## How I tackle this problem
In this thesis, we introduce the use of the attacks, called googa and glomping, which allowed direct measurement of model robustness. 

## How I implement my solution
We describe a series of experiments on each of the four major types of attack, and show that in each case, the attack through evasion affected the safety of a previously perfect secure machine learning model.

## The result
We expect this new approach to contribute to the safety of the automobile industries and reduce the number of colisions caused by attacks, and hence making AI systems more secure.

#### TODO
#### * Convert this argument into a chapter outline
#### * At least one chapter per sentence
#### * maybe more than one for some sentences
#### * Start a folder for each chapter
#### * Set out clearly what each chapter should say
<br>

## Bibliography
#### * Keep a database of complete references
#### * Use a consistent citation style
#### *Use a tool - Bibtex, Refer, Endnote, ProCite, or whatever.
#### * New tools: Mendeley, Zotero, CiteULike,‚Ä¶
#### *Attention to detail is important - Get the spellings right
#### * Keep complete references - page numbers, volume numbers, editors names, locations and dates for conference proceedings, etc.
#### * Find out what the local rules are for citation style
#### * If there are no local rules, use [Author, Year] format - This improves readability by saving the reader #icking to the back
#### * Sure recipe for success - Identify the top peer-reviewed conferences and journals in your area - Ask the experts to help you identify these

Abstract
BACKGROUND: A software engineering systematic map is a defined method to build a classification scheme and structure a software engineering field of interest. The analysis of results focuses on frequencies of publications for categories within the scheme. Thereby, the coverage of the research field can be determined. Different facets of the scheme can also be combined to answer more specific research questions.

OBJECTIVE: We describe how to conduct a systematic mapping study in software engineering and provide guidelines. We also compare systematic maps and systematic reviews to clarify how to chose between them. This comparison leads to a set of guidelines for systematic maps.

METHOD: We have defined a systematic mapping process and applied it to complete a systematic mapping study. Furthermore, we compare systematic maps with systematic reviews by systematically analyzing existing systematic reviews.

RESULTS: We describe a process for software engineering systematic mapping studies and compare it to systematic reviews. Based on this, guidelines for conducting systematic maps are defined.

CONCLUSIONS: Systematic maps and reviews are different in terms of goals, breadth, validity issues and implications. Thus, they should be used complementarily and require different methods (e.g., for analysis).
