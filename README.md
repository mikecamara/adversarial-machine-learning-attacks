Using adversarial machine learning attacks against cars to evaluate the safety of their DNNs [has been done](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-83903-1_14) in a simulation environment. However, to our knowledge, such threats have not been attempted against real-world scaled vehicles before.
