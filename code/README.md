# Code

The code for the autonomous vehicle used as the test-bed for this experiment [can be found in this repository](https://github.com/mikecamara/donkey-car).

The project uses the [IBM Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART)](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox), an open-source Python library for Machine Learning Security that provides tools that enable developers and researchers to defend and evaluate Machine Learning models and applications against the adversarial threats of Evasion, Poisoning, Extraction, and Inference.
